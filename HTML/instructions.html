    <h1>2048 Game Instructions</h1>
    <p>
      The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine
      them to create a tile with the number 2048. The game is won when a tile
      with the number 2048 appears on the board, hence the name of the game.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>
      Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the tiles in the desired
      direction. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into
      one, and their numbers are added together. After every move, a new tile
      with the number 2 or 4 will appear randomly on the board. The game is
      over when the board is full and there are no more moves that can be made.
    </p>
    <h2>Scoring</h2>
    <p>
      The score of the game is determined by the sum of the numbers on the
      tiles that have been merged. The higher the numbers on the merged tiles,
      the higher the score. The game does not have a maximum score.
